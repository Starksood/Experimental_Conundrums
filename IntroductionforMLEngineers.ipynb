This guide will serve as your first introduction to core Keras API concepts.\n","\n","In this guide, you will learn how to:\n","\n","Prepare your data before training a model (by turning it into either NumPy arrays or tf.data.Dataset objects).\n","Do data preprocessing, for instance feature normalization or vocabulary indexing.\n","Build a model that turns your data into useful predictions, using the Keras Functional API.\n","Train your model with the built-in Keras fit() method, while being mindful of checkpointing, metrics monitoring, and fault tolerance.\n","Evaluate your model on a test data and how to use it for inference on new data.\n","Customize what fit() does, for instance to build a GAN.\n","Speed up training by leveraging multiple GPUs.\n","Refine your model through hyperparameter tuning.\n","At the end of this guide, you will get pointers to end-to-end examples to solidify these concepts:\n","\n","1.

Finally, the words need to be indexed & turned into integer tensors.\n","Images need to be read and decoded into integer tensors, then converted to floating point and normalized to small values (usually between 0 and 1).\n","CSV data needs to be parsed, with numerical features converted to floating point tensors and categorical features indexed and converted to integer tensors.

This is a good option if your data fits in memory.\n","TensorFlow Dataset objects. This is a high-performance option that is more suitable for datasets that do not fit in memory and that are streamed from disk or from a distributed filesystem.\n","Python generators that yield batches of data (such as custom subclasses of the keras.utils.Sequence class).\n","Before you start training a model, you will need to make your data available as one of these formats. If you have a large dataset and you are training on GPU(s), consider using Dataset objects, since they will take care of performance-critical details, such as:\n","\n","Asynchronously preprocessing your data on CPU while your GPU is busy, and buffering it into a queue.\n","Prefetching data on GPU memory so it's immediately available when the GPU has finished processing the previous batch, so you can reach full GPU utilization.\n","Keras features a range of utilities to help you turn raw data on disk into a Dataset:\n","\n","tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory turns image files sorted into class-specific folders into a labeled dataset of image tensors.\n","tf.keras.preprocessing.text_dataset_from_directory does the same for text files.\n","In addition, the TensorFlow tf.data includes other similar utilities, such as tf.data.experimental.make_csv_dataset to load structured data from CSV files.\n","\n","Example: obtaining a labeled dataset from image files on disk\n","\n","Supposed you have image files sorted by class in different folders, like this:"]}]}
