This guide will serve as your first introduction to core Keras API concepts.\n","\n","In this guide, you will learn how to:\n","\n","Prepare your data before training a model (by turning it into either NumPy arrays or tf.data.Dataset objects).\n","Do data preprocessing, for instance feature normalization or vocabulary indexing.\n","Build a model that turns your data into useful predictions, using the Keras Functional API.\n","Train your model with the built-in Keras fit() method, while being mindful of checkpointing, metrics monitoring, and fault tolerance.\n","Evaluate your model on a test data and how to use it for inference on new data.\n","Customize what fit() does, for instance to build a GAN.\n","Speed up training by leveraging multiple GPUs.\n","Refine your model through hyperparameter tuning.\n","At the end of this guide, you will get pointers to end-to-end examples to solidify these concepts:\n","\n","1.
